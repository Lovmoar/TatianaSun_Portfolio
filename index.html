                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p> I am full time student at Nothereastern University, pursuing a BFA in Game Art and Animation,
                            with a passion for creativity and colaboration. I am dedicated to honing my skills in game art and animation,
                            and I'm eager to contribute my artistic talents to innovative projects. </p>

                        <p>In this self-filmed and edited video, I challenge the idea of being our own worst critic
                            by presenting a more uplifting perspective: "you are enough." Using a Canon camera and Adobe software,
                            I interviewed friends, family, and strangers, asking them to describe me in a few words or a phrase.
                            The video blends these heartfelt responses with my own artistic vision, promoting self-acceptance and
                            validating personal worth through the eyes of others.</p>

                        <p>This lyric video showcases my skills in animation and video editing. Created using Adobe software,
                            I designed the dynamic background and edited the animation to enhance the lyrical experience.
                            The video combines engaging visuals with the song's lyrics, offering a captivating and immersive
                            viewer experience.</p>

                        <p>Gardenia is a collaborative group project that reimagines classic board games as a charming garden adventure.
                            Our game features a main board shaped like a wooden garden bed with 8x8 holes, and plant-shaped pieces for
                            Tic Tac Toe, Connect 4, and Checkers. Crafted with laser-cut MDF and 3D-printed PLA pieces in black and white,
                            Gardenia offers a fun, travel-sized experience. The board is adorned with garden-themed etchings and storylines
                            that enhance gameplay, making it suitable for all ages 4 and up. Enjoy a refreshing twist on traditional games
                            with our garden-themed narrative!</p>
